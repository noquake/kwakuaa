# kwakuaa
My personal portfolio website. Current domain: https://kwaku-agyei.org/

## Description
This is the source-code for my personal website built from scratch using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The site is curretnly hosted using Github Pages with a custom domain pointing to it. Three of the four planned landings of the site have been built so far, with the interactive terminal still in development. 

## Next Steps
- Dockerizing for easier testing
- Branch seperation to work on features over time before deployment to main site/branch
- Randomized quote picker
- Better "about me" blurb
